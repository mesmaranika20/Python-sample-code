# An exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When an exception occurs, the program stops and an error message is displayed. You have likely seen some exceptions already in the previous lessons. For example, if you try to divide a number by zero, you will get a ZeroDivisionError exception. Try it out in the editor below:

x = 5 / 0
print(x)
