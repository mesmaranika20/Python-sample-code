# Given the variable x and the variable y which have been set for you, write the following
# 1. Print the value of x multiplied by y
# 2. Print the value of the output of step 1 divided by 1.5
# 3. Print the value of the output of step 2 plus by 20
# 4. Print the value of the output of step 3 minus 10.
x = 10
y = 5
step1 = x * y
print( step1)
step2 = step1 / 1.5
print( step2 )
step3 = step2 + 20
print( step3 )
step4 = step3 - 10
print( step4 )
